# komodo-color-schemes
A small collection of color schemes I have created, primarily for my own use, for [ActiveState Komodo IDE/Edit](http://komodoide.com/).

## Solaron-Light and -Dark
Solaron is a pair of schemes based on [Ethan Schoonover's Solarized palette](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized). In most areas, the scheme stays true to that palette, but there are a few areas where I have intentionally differed for either greater or lesser contrast (e.g., choosing a color that is the mathematical midpoint between two greys within the Solarized palette) and based on differences between how Komodo tokenizes languages and renders colors (vs other editors such as TextMate, Sublime, and Atom). I've done a bit of tuning within the scheme, trying to configure colors for consistency across syntaxes for languages and filetypes I frequently work in, and based on my own preferences and habits.
